# WeatherApp-Wear
Weather app that displays the nessecary cloth to wear based on the weather. It's a simple app idea to make your life a little simpler. A project I've built to expand my engineering journey. Also was a self taught process from a start to finsh challenge I made for my self, learned about andriod programming for a week. Then started making the app that was on my mind. Took me total of 14 days to make this project.
